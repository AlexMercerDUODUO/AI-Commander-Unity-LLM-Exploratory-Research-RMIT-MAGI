### üìù Abstract

This paper documents an exploratory study into a potential architectural approach: establishing a low-cost communication pipeline between the Unity game engine and an external LLM (DeepSeek). Through a practice-based research methodology involving functional prototyping and systematic observation, this study reports on the design and preliminary performance of a hierarchical model where the LLM provides high-level tactical commands while traditional state machines handle real-time execution.

---

### üèóÔ∏è Core Architecture

The "AI Commander" system is built on a hierarchical, two-layer architecture that separates strategic reasoning from tactical execution. This approach, guided by the Command Pattern, allows an external LLM to act as a high-level "commander" without the heavy costs and latency of real-time control.

### üí° Key Findings

1.  **Technical Viability:** The communication pipeline between Unity and the LLM is technically functional and robust.
2.  **Remarkable Cost-Effectiveness:** Over a 4-month testing period with 454 API calls, the total operational cost was only **¬•0.67 CNY (~$0.58 USD)**, proving the economic feasibility for indie developers.
3.  **Emergent & Unscripted Behavior:** The LLM autonomously generated a "hold" command‚Äîa conservative tactic that was never explicitly programmed‚Äîdemonstrating contextual reasoning beyond its instructions.
